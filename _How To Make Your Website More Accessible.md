# How To Make Your Website More Accessible

Accessibility is critical to make sure that people with different abilities can use and interact with your website. Making your website more accessible can increase engagement, usability, and success. Below are some tips to make your website accessible to as many people as possible.

## Use Descriptive Headings

Use descriptive headings to give structure to your web pages. These headings make it easier for screen readers users to navigate through the content of your website. Descriptive headings make it easier for people with vision impairments to understand what the content on the page is about.

## Add Alt-Text To Images

Add alt-text to all the images you use on your website. Alt-text denotes what the image is and what message it conveys. By doing this, users with vision impairments will be able to hear what the image is describing.

## Use A High Contrast Color Scheme

Make sure your website uses a high-contrast color scheme with enough difference between background and foreground colors. This makes it easier for people with visual impairments to read the text on your website. Avoid using straining colors.

## Caption Your Videos

Automatically generate captions for all the videos you upload to your website. This is especially important for people with hearing problems. It also makes it easier for anyone to follow along with the video's content, regardless of the environment they are in at that time.

## Use Descriptive Links

Use descriptive link text. This provides context around what the linked page is about instead of using vague terms such as 'click here.' By doing so, screen reader users can have a better understanding of where they will be redirected after clicking on a link, thus improving their user experience.

## Ensure Keyboard Accessibility

Ensure your website is keyboard friendly so that people with mobility issues can browse your website as efficiently as possible. This includes making sure all links and clickable elements are clearly visible and accessible via keyboard navigation. This is also important for people who may not have access to a mouse or touch screen device.

In conclusion, making your website more accessible boosts its usability and reach to other people, which is beneficial to both you as the website owner and your potential audience. By following these tips, you can make a significant difference in the lives of those with disabilities.
