# Introduction to React Router

React Router is a library that allows you to handle routing in single-page applications built with React. Itâ€™s a popular open-source library that provides declarative routing for React applications.

Routing is the process of deciding what happens when a user navigates to a particular URL in our web application. By using React Router, we can define different routes and the corresponding components that should be rendered when a user navigates to them.

## Getting Started

To get started with React Router, we need to install it as a dependency in our project. We can do this by running the following command in our terminal:

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

Once we have installed React Router, we can import it in our application and start defining our routes.

## Defining Routes

In a React application, we can define routes using the `Route` component that is provided by React Router. We can import this component from `react-router-dom` as follows:

```
import { Route } from "react-router-dom";
```

To define a route, we need to specify the `path` prop and the `component` prop. The `path` prop is a string that represents the URL path that should match the route. The `component` prop is the React component that should be rendered when the route is matched.

```
<Route path="/about" component={About} />
```

In the above example, when a user navigates to the `/about` path, the `About` component will be rendered.

We can define as many routes as we need in our application. If we want to define a default route, we can use the `exact` prop to make sure that the route matches exactly.

```
<Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
```

In the above example, when a user navigates to the root path (`/`), the `Home` component will be rendered.

## Navigation

To navigate between different routes, we can use the `Link` component that is also provided by React Router. We can import this component from `react-router-dom` as follows:

```
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
```

We can create a link by using the `to` prop and specifying the path that we want to navigate to.

```
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

In the above example, when we click on the `About` link, we will be navigated to the `/about` path.

## Conclusion

React Router is a popular library that allows us to handle routing in single-page applications built with React. By defining routes and using the `Route` and `Link` components provided by React Router, we can create a navigation system that enables users to move between different parts of our application.
